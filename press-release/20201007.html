CCPA in particular gives California residents a legal right to opt out of the sale of their data and requires businesses to respect user preferences through a signal from their web browser communicating the consumer’s request to opt out. </p> <p> While this is great progress, it doesn't amount to much if it is hard for people to take advantage of their new rights. Today, there is no defined or accepted technical standard for how such a web browser signal would work. Without that, users don't have an easy way to express their preferences. </p> <p> Indeed, in his <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/services/files/47115516-3540-4AB8-8676-57882CF6B9E0">recent testimony before the US Senate</a>, California Attorney General <a href="https://twitter.com/agbecerra?s=21">Xavier Becerra</a> explained: </p> <blockquote class="blockquote"> <p class="mb-0"> One provision of our regulations intended to facilitate the submission of a request to opt-out of sale by requiring businesses to comply when a consumer has enabled a global privacy control at the device or browser level, which should be less time-consuming and burdensome. I urge the technology community to develop consumer-friendly controls to make exercise of the right to opt out of the sale of information meaningful and frictionless. </p> </blockquote> <p> This effort, initially spearheaded by <a href="https://twitter.com/ashk4n">Ashkan Soltani</a> (<a href="https://www.georgetowntech.org">Georgetown Law</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/SZimmeck">Sebastian Zimmeck</a> (<a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu">Wesleyan University</a>) now includes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic (WordPress.com &amp; Tumblr)</a>, <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://disconnect.me">Disconnect</a>, <a href="https://www.abine.com">Abine</a>, <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org">Digital Content Next (DCN)</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</a>. </p> <p> In the initial experimental phase, individuals can download browsers and extensions from <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>, <a href="https://www.eff.org">EFF</a>, <a href="https://disconnect.me">Disconnect</a>, and <a href="https://www.abine.com">Abine</a> in order to communicate their "do not sell or share" preference to participating publishers.
